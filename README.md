## Building the Project

### Requirements:

- a Golang installation (built & tested on Go v1.22)
- an internet connection to download dependencies (only necessary if dependencies have changed or this is the first build)
- a `make` installation. This project is built with GNU make v4; full compatibility with other versions of make (such as that shipped by Apple) is not guaranteed.

To build the project, simply run `make` in the project's root directory to build the output executable.

> _Note: running with `make` is not strictly necessary. Reference the provided `Makefile` for typical development commands._
